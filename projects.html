<p>The transportation industry is responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions in 
the atmosphere. Researchers have been exploring methods to maximize growth and lipid production in algae. 
Algae are the most promising candidates for future fuels because of their unique ability to produce a high 
lipid concentration.

The algae lipids, high energy hydrocarbons, are harvested and extracted from the algal cells and 
refined to produce biodiesel. STEM students selected the micro-algae Chlorella vulgaris in this 
research for its ability to produce high lipid content. An increase in general algal growth can be 
accomplished by exposing the organisms to optimal conditions, which include various parameters such as 
nutrient source, light intensity, oxygen level, carbon dioxide level, pH, and photobioreactor design.

The main purpose of the project’s study is to determine which MG dilution provides most optimal growth 
under controlled conditions.

<p>Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University and 
Stanford University are trying to utilize the wisdom of the citizens with designing 
of an online video game(EteRNA) that asks the players to create new ways to fold RNA molecules. 
The scientists are looking forward to discover primary rules essential for one of the life’s building blocks. 
They think that the ETeRNA game will also serve as a training ground for a group of citizen-experts 
who will help to make a new depository for biological knowledge. This game may also aid researchers in 
constructing stronger automated algorithms for biological breakthroughs. So in Bergen Community college 
as our first project in Computational Chemistry group, we are going to 
Play EteRNA game and see how we are going to help the science. </p>

<p>The Computer Vision team is working on autonomously landing an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on a recharging station. In order to do this, STEM students needed first to get the 3D world coordinates. They accomplished this by constructing a stereo camera from two off-the-shelf high-definition web cameras and calibrating it with a 4’ x 4’ chessboard pattern. Using the open source Intel OpenCV library of functions in C and C++, custom-designed software was written to motion track user chosen colored objects to determine their 3D coordinates. In the summer 2014, STEM Students worked in constructing a stereo camera with a wider baseline to track objects at far distances. For future plans, students will use a method to track the UAV called SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features), rather than using color tracking. This entails matching the UAV in real time with its picture through point detection and feature matching. The SURF algorithm should provide a more robust way to track the object and find its 3D world coordinates than color tracking. </p>

<p>STEM Student Union Psychophysiology and Neurophysiology Experimentation and Research The Stem Student Union has obtained professionally developed instrumentation with a pedagogic learning system (from BioPac) so that students can methodically and formally learn about psychophysiology and neurophysiology. Students perform laboratory exercises to conduct basic physiology experiments using ECG, EEG, EMG, and EOG for the purpose of studying Muscular, Cardiovascular, Neurophysiology and Biomedical Engineering topics. In addition, the Stem Student Union has obtained equipment (from OpenBCI) that is designed to encourage original experimentation and product engineering in the development of software and hardware in the field of brain computer interfaces. In order to be qualified to use the equipment of this project, students must pass a rigorous safety training program. This project will pool the interests of students from a wide range of disciplines. Not only will it attract students who may be studying Biology or Psychology while at Bergen who are ultimately interested in medical careers, but via projects that involve brain-computer interfaces, these projects can also attract the interest of Computer Science majors and Engineering majors. </p>

<p>This project deals with the development of a portable ground station for outdoor drone/robot remote control. The main goals of this ground station are to provide STEM Student Union members with a better visibility while flying UAVs (Unmanned Air Vehicle), and protection against weather conditions in a comfortable and appropriate environment. During the summer, STEM Student Union interns had an amazing engineering experience building the ground station. From scratch, they brainstormed ideas; with a computer software created a design, and built the ground station almost to its completion. </p>

<p>The High Altitude Balloon team builds electronic sensor payloads as well as other types of experiments and launches them 100,000 feet into the air (Well above where commercial airlines fly) using Weather balloons. They keep a Blog of their activities with information on when they plan to launch a balloon next. </p>

<p>The newly formed BCC Robotics Team is beginning on our journey of discovery during summer of 2015. </p>
<p>With a group varying in skill level from beginner to advanced and interests 
ranging from mechanical engineering to computer science, anyone and everyone can contribute and learn. </p>
<p>We're starting out with some simple things the whole team can work on, getting 
motor and sensor functions working with Arduino, getting practice with basic wiring and programming. </p>
<p>Over the summer we'll be working towards a creating a rover type robot 
incorporating autonomous movement, remote management, advanced sensors and more. 
Currently we're looking at applications in agriculture but with an open mind towards competitions, 
and the many other potential uses.</p>

<p>UV-4 V/STOL UAV is an uncrewed aerial vehicle designed to transport cargo via autonomous or 
remote pilot operations. </p>
<p>Students of Bergen Community College participated in several factors leading to this new aircraft design. </p>
<p>Advanced aircraft simulation created hours of logbook support consisting of natural 
scenarios and ensuring optimal operations in adverse conditions. </p>
<p>The project logbook supports hours of flying in real world environments; completing several 
flight tests, including climb rate, maneuverability in weather conditions, and emergency 
procedures among other flight and support systems.</p> 
<p>The UV-4 UAV is the College’s first functional 3-D printed aircraft. </p>
<p>The STEM initiatives at Bergen Community College (BCC) promote teamwork and creativity.</p>
