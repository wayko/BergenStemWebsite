<h3>B2B: Bridge to the Baccalaureate</h3>
 The <b>B2B</b> is a <B>National Science Foundation Grant</b> with the goal to increase the number of minority STEM students (Spanish, Black, American Indian, Native Hawaiian and South Pacific Islander) 
 transferring from Bergen Community College to a 4 year College.  Minority students are the recipients of this grant because their graduation rates in these high paying jobs (see: What are STEM salaries?)
 are significantly lower than those of other groups.  
 <br /><br /> 
 The strategies adapted in the implementation of this grant are those that have proved successful in increasing STEM student success, research 
 opportunities, creation of a STEM cadre i.e.,  a learning community of STEM students, easy access to tutoring help, development of mentoring relationships with faculty and student mentors, 
 and establishment of relationship with local 4 year colleges within the B2B LsAmp consortia that will facilitate your making a good connections at these schools and insure a smooth transition 
 to the school of your choice.  
  <br /><br />
 Once at one of these participating schools you will be welcomed in under the LSAMP grant which will provide further assistance to ensure your success and even 
 facilitate your receiving a free graduate education.

<p>The Northern New Jersey Bridges to Baccalaureate (NNJ-B2B) Alliance is a partnership of (5) public associate degree institutions of Northern New Jersey committed to assisting underrepresented minority students in successfully transferring into a baccalaureate STEM program.</p>

<p>NNJ-B2B forms a synergistic partnership with the GS-LSAMP, a highly successful NSF funded project headed by Rutgers University- Newark that includes eight largely public four year colleges and universities in the region to develop a transformative model for streamlined transition from 2-4 year institution. </p>
